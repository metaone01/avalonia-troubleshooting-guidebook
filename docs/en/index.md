# Avalonia Troubleshooting Guidebook

Since Avalonia's documentation is not comprehensive and there are many difficulties in multi-os development, this guide was created to document various errors and their solutions, and answer questions for beginners.

If you find this guide helpful or think it will help you, please consider starring [this project](https://github.com/metaone01/avalonia-troubleshooting-guidebook).

> [!NOTE]
> The scope of this guide covers all errors encountered when writing Avalonia programs, regardless of whether the errors themselves are related to Avalonia.
